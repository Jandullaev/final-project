# Final Project

## Before we start
The aim of this project is to create a web application that meets all the characteristics (features) listed in your proposal.  

Please know that you only need to implement the front-end part. The back end can be implemented if desired. Data can be stored locally. It is recommended to use JSON files, Firebase, or Apiary.  


## Project Implementation
To guide you through the process, the project implementation is divided into five main stages: 
	Setup 
	Web application development 
	Project compilation 
	Validation 
	Submission 

In each stage, you will find a list of required steps, evaluation criteria, and helpful resources to refer to if you have any questions.
